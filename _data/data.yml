experiences:
  - role: Robotics Software Intern
    time: July, 2019 - October, 2019
    company: Mainblades Inspections, The Hague, Netherlands
    details: |
      I was primarily responsible for improving the control and navigation pipeline
      for a DJI Matrice 200 used for aircraft inspections. My major contributions included:
        - Sampling based trajectory control with cubic spline interpolation. This was an improvement over the 
          existing waypoint control algorithm. I was able to reduce the destination overshoot by 2.5% and generate 
          smoother motion.
        - Adapted the existing Non-linear Model predictive controller to ACADO Toolkit framework using qpOASES solver.
          Achieved better velocity control with improved robustness towards inaccurate localization data.
  - role: Robotics and Motion Intern
    time: Jan, 2018 â€“ April, 2018
    company: ABB, Bengaluru, India
    details: |
      Being in the R&D department for robotics, I was responsible to come up with a customer friendly approach to modify
      SmartComponent logic in RobotStudio.
      in RobotStudio.
        - Proposed a sparse lookup table based approach to simplify the input/output logic of SmartComponent. 
          This would allow customers to make modifications to SmartComponent functionalities without depending on the manufacturer.
        - Successfully defended my approach against an existing FPGA based SmartComponent logic which required customers to reprogram the FPGA
          to make any modifications.
thesis:
  - role: Knowledge Adaption and Hierarchical Incremental Learning using Radial Basis Function
      Networks for taxonomy-based data classification.
    time: November, 2019 - December, 2020
    company: Delft Center for Systems and Control
    details: |
      To tackle the issues of large training time and retraining in cases when new information becomes available, 
      I propose a new method which uses Radial Basis Function(RBF) Neural networks on a neuromorphic chip. 
      The RBF network can grow, learn and adapt as new data becomes available in a tree-like fashion to accommodate 
      new classes of data while retaining the property of distinguishing previously trained classes. 
        - The above method is catered to categorize road signs as a test.  
        - Add new information to the hierarchical network without altering the previously trained model.
        - Generalize this approach to accommodate almost any taxonomy based on classification indicators.
        - Introduce uncertainty in the neural network for robust classification.
