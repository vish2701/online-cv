experiences:
    - role: Robotics Software Intern
      time: July, 2019 - October, 2019
      company: Mainblades Inspections, The Hague, Netherlands
      details: |
        I was primarily responsible for improving the control and navigation pipeline
        for a DJI Matrice 200 used for aircraft inspections. My major contributions included:
          - Sampling based trajectory control with cubic spline interpolation. This was an improvement over the 
            existing waypoint control algorithm. I was able to reduce the destination overshoot by 2.5% and generate 
            smoother motion.
          - Adapted the existing Non-linear Model predictive controller to ACADO Toolkit framework using qpOASES solver.
            Achieved better velocity control with improved robustness towards inaccurate localization data.
    - role: Robotics and Motion Intern
      time: Jan, 2018 – April, 2018
      company: ABB, Bengaluru, India
      details: |
        Being in the R&D department for robotics, I was responsible to come up with a customer friendly approach to modify
        SmartComponent logic in RobotStudio.
        in RobotStudio.
          - Proposed a sparse lookup table based approach to simplify the input/output logic of SmartComponent. 
            This would allow customers to make modifications to SmartComponent functionalities without depending on the manufacturer.
          - Successfully defended my approach against an existing FPGA based SmartComponent logic which required customers to reprogram the FPGA
            to make any modifications.
    - role: UI Developer
      time: 2012 - 2014
      company: Amazon, London
